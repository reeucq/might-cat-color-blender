# Color Blending

This repository contains some python scripts that can be used to combine multiple hex colors into a single color. The following methods are used in each of the available script:

- blend-using-am.py : Arithmetic Mean
- blend-using-gm.py : Geometric Mean
- blend-using-hsl.py : HSL Color Space
- blend-using-lab.py : LAB Color Space
- blend-using-luminance.py : Luminance
- blend-using-sqrm.py : Square Root Mean

Additionary since this was made for Van Gogh project, There's also a file called 'van-gogh-painting-colors.txt' that contains the hex colors of the Van Gogh paintings that were used in the my other project called vanity.

You can also create a pull request to add more methods to blend the colors.
